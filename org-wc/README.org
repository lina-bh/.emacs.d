* org-wc.el
A word count library for emacs org mode.  It shows the word count per
heading line, summed over sub-headings.

The design goal is to be really fast, rather than to count exactly, so it
doesn't check too carefully what it's counting.

The implementation is based on
- Paul Sexton's word count posted on org-mode mailing list on 21 February 2011.
- clock overlays
